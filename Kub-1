Given the following files:

ui-config.yaml
color.good=purple
color.bad=yellow
allow.textmode=true
game-config.yaml

kubectl create configmap "training-game-config" --from-file=ui.properties="./ui-config.yaml" --from-file="./game-config.yaml" --from-literal=secret.code=secret.code.lives=30
What would the resulting ConfigMap object look like?

Ans:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: training-game-config
data:  
  ui.properties: |
    color.good=purple
    color.bad=yellow
    allow.textmode=true
  game-config.yaml: |
    enemies=aliens
    lives=3
  secret.code: secret.code.lives=30
