===============================================================================================================
1. You are building a modern application that holds sensitive data (such as social security numbers). You aim to avoid threats that occur when clients accept access tokens from sources other than intentional requests to a token endpoint. Which protocol would you chose for authentication?
Ans: OAuth 2.0 with HTTPS and relevant grant types

2.In a Spring controller how can you get the current UserDetails object?
Ans:public String currentUserName(Authentication authentication) {
    UserDetails userDetails = (UserDetails) authentication.getPrincipal();
    ...
}

3. When securing an API using Spring Security, you often use BCrypt to encode the password. However, the BCrypt hashing algorithm is really slow. Why does this happen?
Ans: To avoid Brute Force Attacks.

4. What is an advantage of using @PreAuthorize Spring Security annotation over the @Secured annotation to secure a controller method?
Ans: The @PreAuthorize permits the use of SpEL security expressions.

5. How can you configure a Spring application to use a relational database for user authentication?
Ans: @Autowired
public void configureAuth(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth, DataSource dataSource) throws Exception {
    auth.jdbcAuthentication()
        .dataSource(dataSource);
} 

6. What are the requirements for a verification token that is being used to verify an email address of a user when they register an account?
Ans: It should be a randomly generated value of sufficient length and time limited.

7. When using a custom UserDetailsService what authentication provider should be used?
Ans: DaoAuthenticationProvider

8. How can you ensure the controller method Profile getProfileByName(String name) can only be invoked with the current authenticated user's name with Spring Security?\
Ans: @PreAuthorize("#name == authentication.name")

==============================================================================================================================

1: What would you implement the following Spring Security configure method in order to redirect the user to an access-denied page in case they try to access an unauthorized resource?
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {}
Ans: http.authorizeRequests().permitAll().and().accessDeniedPage("/accessDenied.jsp");[True]


2:After adding Spring Security dependency to the classpath, the access to any URL other than the login form is restricted. What does Spring Security use to add mandatory authentication?
Ans: Filter

3. How can you secure the following controller method so that it can only be invoked by users that are a member of the admin  role using Spring Security?
public void deleteAccount(String accountId) {
}
Ans: @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
public void deleteAccount(String accountId) {
}


4: What is the default behavior for Cache Control security header included with the Spring Security Framework?
Ans: Disable caching to protect user's content

5. You are tasked with adding two factor authentication to a Spring application. How can you do this?
Ans: Implement a custom AuthenticationDetailsSource  and AuthenticationProvider  which will capture and verify the second authentication factor.

6. Which browser security headers included with Spring Security Framework reduce the possibility of on-path attacks?
Ans. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)


7. You are debugging a Spring application that has a global exception handler class. That class contains the annotations @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.
