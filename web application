The technical documentation

14. What is a feature of password-based key derivation functions?
They have a sliding computational cost.

15. Your application uses YAML serialization format. What is a valid reason for your development team to look at Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) A8: Insecure Deserialization?
Insecure de-serialization is independent of the format.

16. An application deals with sensitive information. After a serious security breach, the development team changes the lifespan of keys. Which factors should the team consider when deciding on a new lifespan?
The volume of information flow, the security life of the data, and the key rollover method

17. Which aspect of a system can reliably manage the state of an application?
The application itself

Ensure that each deployment uses a hardened base instance.

21. When is a cross-site scripting vulnerability necessary for performing a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack?
When no measures to mitigate the effects of CSRF are in place

22. What is the intention of a secure password reset process?
To ensure that the password reset process cannot be abused

23. How can you prevent most access control vulnerabilities?
By using centralized access control checks

24. The client receives a message or file. What sets the HTTP security headers?
The server

25. You decrypt your private Secure Shell (SSH) key before logging on to a server that uses public key authentication. Why is this not multi-factor authentication?
Because you only need the private key file

26. What is a limitation of XML External Entity (XXE) attacks?
They can only obtain files or responses that contain “valid” XML.

27. What is data serialization?
Converting an object into a byte stream

28. How would you associate a document type definition with an XML document?
Using a document type declaration tag (DOCTYPE)

29. A development team wants to write secure code. According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Proactive Controls, what should the team do first?
Define its security requirements.

30. What is input validation?
Validating whether the input matches a given format

31.  A server attempts to parse the following XML file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
	<!ENTITY lol "lol">
	<!ENTITY lol2 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
	<!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
	<!ENTITY lol4 "&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;">
	<!ENTITY lol5 "&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;">
	<!ENTITY lol6 "&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;">
	<!ENTITY lol7 "&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;">
	<!ENTITY lol8 "&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;">
	<!ENTITY lol9 "&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8">

]>
<foo>&lol9;</foo>
What is the outcome?

Correct:It overloads the memory of the XML parser with expanding XML entities. 

32. A web server redirects visitors of the outside.html page to an external domain based on user input. When is this an unvalidated redirect?
When the web server does not validate the request

33. What is a denial-of-service attack?
An attempt to deplete the target's resources to render it unusable
